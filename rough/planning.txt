Story:
you're a traveling mage with an uncanny ability to read old scripts and learn new spells from them

an evil magic called Mayhem is about to awaken erupting from the grounds of Altea
to put it back to sleep you need to venture to 3 different dimensions and kill the Mayham's agents to restore peace in those dimensions
once all dimensions have been purged by Mayhem influences, then the threat will be avoided
but you get tricked (going on a mislead rampage), killing the agents triggers the awakening of Mayhem
turns out the person who said the prophecy about Mayhem was lying and is a secret Mayhem worshipper
the agents were guardians of these dimensions and keep Mayhem in his tomb,

        - would get rid of the statuses of chests, and chests in general
    + power level of monsters will have key words and colors instead of just colors
    + different power leveled monsters give out different amount of experience points
    + merchants add spells
    + player can forget their own spells
    + combining spells? spellweaver class
    + player has starting spells, health, and experience
    + (extra features) player name, pronouns?

    (New) The player is a traveling mage. On their jounrey they come across The Great of Altea,

    (Hidden) Unable to remember their past life, they wondered the plains for days until they stumbled upon a small rustic cabin within the deep woods.
    With the last bit of their energy they limped to the cabin's front porch and managed to knock on the door a few times before they collapsed on the ground.
    When they awoken they found themselves inside the cabin laying in a soft warm bed. A steaming bowl of porridge was on the nightstand beside them.
