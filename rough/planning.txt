----- Idea 3 ----- (too many places, too complex)
Game Mechanics:
    + instead of getting spells from chests, have the player trade in experience for spells from merchants
        - would get rid of the statuses of chests, and chests in general
    + power level of monsters will have key words and colors instead of just colors
    + different power leveled monsters give out different amount of experience points
    + merchants add spells
    + player can forget their own spells
    + combining spells? spellweaver class
    + player has starting spells, health, and experience
    + (extra features) player name, pronouns?
    + exploring outside the city finding answers to put Altea to sleep

Brainstorm:
    + 3 crystals keeps Altea asleep
        + city is safe and you're awarded a home within the city and a position in the court along with riches
    + 3 relics wakes up Altea but doesn't destroy the city, her powers are diminished but she does fights you, you have to calm her down by defeating her
        + she'll tell you about her life story and what it's like being awake while your body sleeps
        + angry at the people taking advantage of her while she suffers
    + deciding not to put anything on the pedestals will destroy the city
        + Altea will wake imploding the city and destroy life on the planet except you
        + new adam and eve
    + 3 guardians protect the crystals
        + crystals provide life to their realm, once taken everything there dimensions
        + if you don't want to kill their life, you can help them defeat monsters that threaten their livelihoods
        + defeating the monsters gets you their powerful relics
    +

Abstract Story:
    (Old) you're a traveling mage with an uncanny ability to read old scripts and learn new spells from them
    tasked to defeat monsters and save Altea from destruction by the royal prophet
    an evil magic called Mayhem is about to awaken erupting from the grounds of Altea
    to put it back to sleep you need to venture to 3 different dimensions and kill the Mayham's agents to restore peace in those dimensions
    once all dimensions have been purged by Mayhem influences, then the threat will be avoided
    but you get tricked (going on a mislead rampage), killing the agents triggers the awakening of Mayhem
    turns out the person who said the prophecy about Mayhem was lying and is a secret Mayhem worshipper

    (New) The player is a traveling mage. On their journey they come across The Great City of Altea. (One of the most powerful and advanced cities on the planet.)
    There they meet the High Prophet from the Church of Dia who warns them about the impending doom of their great city.
    Altea, a being of immense power, sleeps beneath the great city. In their slomber they emit pure energy which powers the city. (This energy also powers the magical defense dome that protects the city from outer threats.)
    However that energy is the residual power resonating from the being's dorment body. If Altea were to awaken and unleash all of its power the city would implode leaving no trace of its existance. (The energy would create so much heat within the bubble that it would melt everything burn up the air that when it cools down the heat escapes creating a suction from within the globe crushing itself.)
    The High Prophet forsees the great being's awakening, and bestow the player with the important task of putting Altea back to sleep.

    (Hidden) Unable to remember their past life, they wondered the plains for days until they stumbled upon a small rustic cabin within the deep woods.
    With the last bit of their energy they limped to the cabin's front porch and managed to knock on the door a few times before they collapsed on the ground.
    When they awoken they found themselves inside the cabin laying in a soft warm bed. A steaming bowl of porridge was on the nightstand beside them...
