Story:
you're a traveling mage with an uncanny ability to read old scripts and learn new spells from them
tasked to defeat monsters and save Altea from destruction by the royal prophet
an evil magic called Mayhem is about to awaken erupting from the grounds of Altea
to put it back to sleep you need to venture to 3 different dimensions and kill the Mayham's agents to restore peace in those dimensions
once all dimensions have been purged by Mayhem influences, then the threat will be avoided
but you get tricked (going on a mislead rampage), killing the agents triggers the awakening of Mayhem
turns out the person who said the prophecy about Mayhem was lying and is a secret Mayhem worshipper
the agents were guardians of these dimensions and keep Mayhem in his tomb, 
but when killed the force keeping Mayhem underground weakens thus releasing Mayhem
your ultimate goal would be to defeat Mayhem once and for all
