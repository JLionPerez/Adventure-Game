Throughout your journey you will encounter enemies and allies.
You can identify enemies and allies by the color of their names.
Enemies will be in red, and allies will be in cyan.

For example, goblins are enemies and mermaids are allies.


Chests will also be in varying colors signifying their rarity.
Here is a list of chests ranking in rarity:
    Common Chests are blue.
    Uncommon Chests are green.
    Rare Chests are yellow.
    Legendary Chests are magenta.

The strength of spells depends on the rarity of the chest of which it came from.
