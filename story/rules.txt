Before we begin, I must tell you the rules of this game.

Many items, such as weapons and armor, are scattered throughout this world for you to find.
The type of items you pick up and use determines your profession.
For example, if you pick up an Iron Dagger, and a Black Hood, you essentially become a thief.
