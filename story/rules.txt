Throughout your journey you will encounter enemies and allies.
You can identify enemies and allies by the color of their names.
Enemies will be in red, and allies will be in cyan.

For example, goblins are enemies and mermaids are allies.

Chests will also be in varying colors signifying their rarity.
    Common_Chests are blue.
    Uncommon_Chests are green.
    Rare_Chests are yellow.
    Legendary_Chests are magenta.

The strength of the spell depends on the rarity of the chest of which it came from.

For example, if you open a Common_Chest you might be given a Minor_Heal spell.
